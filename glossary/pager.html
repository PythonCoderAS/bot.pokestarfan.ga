<p>A pager is a special type of <a href="/glossary/menu">menu</a> that contains buttons for moving through several pages of content. A pager internally contains a list of messages, and the different buttons can be used to change the page that is being currently shown.</p>
<p>A pager can also have other buttons that take actions other than modifying the page shown.</p>
<h1>Pager Buttons</h1>
<h2>First</h2>
<p>This button takes you to the first page. It is grayed out if the pager is already on the first page.</p>
<h2>Previous</h2>
<p>This button takes you to the previous page. It is grayed out if the pager is already on the first page.</p>
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>This button takes you to the next page. It is grayed out if the pager is already on the last page.</p>
<h2>Last</h2>
<p>This button takes you to the last page. It is grayed out if the pager is already on the last page.</p>
<h2>Info</h2>
<p>This button sends you information on the current page and total pages.</p>
<h2>Page to Go To</h2>
<p>This select bar shows the pages you can go to. <strong>Due to Discord limits, only 25 pages can be displayed at a time.</strong> However, when you go to certain pages, the options shift, allowing you to get to more than just 25 pages. For example, at page 14, the top option becomes 2. In general, you can see the options for the current page, the 12 pages before the current page, and the 12 pages after the current page. If there are less than 12 pages to the last page, more than 12 pages before the current page may be displayed. If the paginator contains 25 pages or less, the page options will not ever change.&nbsp;</p>
