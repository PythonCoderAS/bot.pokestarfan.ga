<p>A menu is a block of text or an <a href="/glossary/embed">embed</a> that contains a bunch of buttons. Clicking on each button will run a different action. The menu may or may not contain information detailing what each of the buttons does. If the menu does not contain the information then the information can be found in the documentation of the command that generated the menu. Menus typically work up to 5 minutes after they were generated, but they may be pruned earlier if the bot needs to clear resources.</p>
