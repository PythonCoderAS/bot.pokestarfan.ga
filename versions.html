<p>PokestarBot can be separated into 3 versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Version 0, the test bot that I made.</li>
  <li>Version 1, the first public version of PokestarBot. As of August 2021, it is the version running under the PokestarBot account.</li>
  <li>Version 2, the second public version of PokestarBot, and in development. As of August 2021, it is the version running under the PokestarBotTest account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 1 is deprecated and will not receive any bug fixes. Once Version 2 has sufficient features, it will be moved to the PokestarBot account, and the PokestarBotTest account will be offline.</p>
