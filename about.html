<p>PokestarBot is a <a href="https://discord.com">Discord</a> bot that provides a wide array of features. The bot allows users to define their own profiles, expand Reddit links, and even host their own "waifu wars" using a database of entries maintained by the author. Furthermore, it provides moderators the capability to run actions en masse based on the role(s) that a <a href="/glossary/member">member</a> has, or even the members inside a voice channel.</p>
<h2><strong>Inspiration</strong></h2>
<p>The inspiration of PokestarBot came when I was trying to organize watch parties. Since we arbitrarily decided who would attend which watch party, I wanted to be able to copy all of the users in a voice channel into a pingable role. Furthermore, members of one watch party would also agree to another watch party, so I wanted to be able to copy-paste roles as well as the members who belonged to the roles. I set out to write a simple bot that did just that. Once I finished, I realized that I could write more commands to do more things, and so PokestarBot started.</p>
